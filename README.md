This repository demonstrates a common VBScript error related to late binding and provides a solution using early binding. Late binding, while offering flexibility, can lead to runtime errors if the referenced objects or methods don't exist.  The example shows how to improve robustness by using early binding, which involves explicitly defining object types. This approach prevents errors by catching type mismatches at compile time, making the script more reliable.  The provided solution showcases the best practice of using early binding in VBScript to avoid runtime surprises related to object existence.
